# 🌐 TSL Shader Template – React Three Fiber + WebGPU

A modern, WebGPU-ready shader template using **TSL (Three Shading Language)**, **React Three Fiber**, and **Leva** for live parameter control.

This project is a translation of the iconic shader from [The Art of Code – Shader Art](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4s1h2YETNY&t=1186s), originally written in GLSL for Shadertoy. It’s now rewritten using TSL – the new node-based shader system for Three.js.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Built with **TSL** – Three.js Shading Language
- ✅ Powered by **WebGPU** via `THREE.WebGPURenderer`
- ✅ Fully reactive with **React Three Fiber**
- ✅ Live tweaking with **Leva**
- ✅ Open source and easy to fork for your own experiments
